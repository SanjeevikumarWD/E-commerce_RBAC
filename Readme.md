User Flow:
Admin: Can view users, orders, stocks, and sales. They can register staff members and make them inactive.
Manager/Staff: Can view and manage product listings (add, edit, delete).
User: Can create an account, add items to the cart, and proceed to checkout.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented to ensure that only admins can create accounts for managers and staff, while users can only register themselves.
JWT Authentication is used to protect routes and manage user sessions.
